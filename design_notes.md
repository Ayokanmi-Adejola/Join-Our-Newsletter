# Design Review Notes

- Please refer to the images in the `design/` folder for Desktop, Tablet, and Mobile layouts.
- To match the design exactly, pay attention to:
  - Card background, border radius, and shadow
  - Spacing and padding
  - Font sizes, weights, and colors
  - Input and button styling
  - Responsive layout for different breakpoints
  - Placement and size of the logo
  - Text alignment and line heights

## Next Steps
- Review the design images and update the HTML/CSS to match the visual details as closely as possible.
- Use the Desktop_1350px.jpg as the primary reference for desktop layout.
- Use Tablet_1024px.jpg and Mobile_412px.jpg for responsive adjustments.
